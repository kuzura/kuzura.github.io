<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	The following is a communication I wrote for the Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL) to pass on to their Balkan network of doctors, NGO's, and policymakers. It was inspired by my Watson travels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by the speakers at the Indigenous People's Day at the UN COP23 Climate Conference.

<h2>The Piece</h2>

<p>
	Balkan citizens can achieve strong outcomes on climate, public health, and other problems if they organize to effect bottom-up change.
</p>

<p>
	 Unfortunately, my travels in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have shown that a majority of citizens are hopelessly inactive in the face of ecological, public health, political, economic, and countless other problems affecting them. An all-too-common expectation that the government solve the people’s problems remains from the Yugoslavian era, and keeps the common folk disorganized and powerless in the face of pernicious politics. A contradictory but equally common belief in BiH is that corrupt high-level government officials and foreign business interests have no interest in helping the “little people.” As Rodion, and indigenous presenter from Siberia put it, “decisions are made in the capital [or corporate headquarters]; effects are felt on the ground.” Indeed, BiH suffers from such a dynamic. For example, chronic cough grips Tuzla’s citizens because the poorly placed coal-electric power plant shrouds the city in smog. But the people don’t feel empowered to act and advocate on their own behalf, they wish someone else would fix the problem, and they know the powerful people aren’t interested in helping. They expect help from a source they know won’t deliver. 
</p>

<p>
	Citizens, however, have great capacity to effect change that governments and corporations won’t. If the people can be inspired to organize and act to fix their own problems—regardless of type—they can drive change from the bottom-up. For example, an indigenous Peruvian man working for the conservation of Amarakaeri Communal Reserve reported that forests protected by indigenous communities faced ten times less deforestation than government-sponsored “Protected Area” forests. Furthermore, a 2011 review by Porter-Bolland et al. found that community-protected forests faced equal or lesser deforestation than government-managed forests. These examples indicate that the supposedly powerless “little people” can actually effect equal or greater change to that of their governments. I attended multiple panels about the “little people” organizing to solve big problems that governments and businesses wouldn’t solve at Indigenous People’s Day at COP23. The below citizen organization strategy is inspired by Jason Spensley of Green Climate Fund, and the central organizations’ support of bottom-up movements is inspired by Filipe Lucio of World Meteorological Organization.

	 To enact a change, the actors must first identify a specific problem to be solved. BiH citizens, in my experience, seldom verbalized specific problems; instead, they spoke in vague terms like “there are no jobs” or “the power plant is making me sick.” Without a clear and distinct idea of the problem to be solved, no action can take place. The problem can be qualitative (“I always cough when in Tuzla, and only when in Tuzla”) or quantitative (“BiH reports a 40% unemployment rate”). The initial problem statement then facilitates an intensive research phase, where the actors must gather qualitative or quantitative data on the problem. Qualitative data can be gathered by interviewing a diverse sample of the concerned demographic by, for example, conducting brief interviews door-to-door. On the other hand, citizens can search the internet, ask local officials, politicians, and businessmen for information, or conduct their own surveys and statistical analysis to obtain concrete quantitative data. I stress the importance of having both qualitative and quantitative data in support of one’s argument. A nuclear energy activist with a purely qualitative argument, for example, gave an embarrassingly unconvincing answer to a concerned citizen’s question supported by qualitative and quantitative evidence during the day’s proceedings. The active citizen equipped with knowledge, in that case, created a very real roadblock to a powerful interest’s advocacy. BiH citizens can similarly organize to become an entity capable of standing up to the large problems hounding them. Once citizen actors clearly identify a problem, they must identify a concrete goal: the achievement of a crowd-sourced solution, convincing a powerful actor to enact change, or another outcome. Finally, the steps toward the solution are democratically executed.

	 Citizen action can also be buttressed by central organizations, such as NGO’s, providing information or resources. Filipe Lucio, in working with Malawi farmers, found that indigenous communities are resistant to outside ideas because the latter are either confusing or delivered by seemingly untrustworthy messengers. Outside messages must be made easy to understand and delivered by a local community member who is perceived as trustworthy by the community. An example scheme is an NGO delivering email, SMS, or radio messaging to local community members, who then propagate the info to neighbors. An example proposed by Dr. Joseph Ravenell is to distribute messages through community centers, like barbershops, in which locals have established and regular relationships with business operators (2016). An example Balkan application is posting info in Sportske Kladionice.

<p>
	A populace with a coherent understanding of the problems facing them and the paths to solutions for said problems, supported by guiding central organizations, has great potential to enact life-improving change.
