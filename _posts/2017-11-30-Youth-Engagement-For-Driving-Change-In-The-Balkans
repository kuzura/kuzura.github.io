title: "Youth Engagement For Driving Change In The Balkans"

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	The following is a communication I wrote for the Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL) to pass on to their Balkan network of doctors,
  NGO's, and policymakers. It was inspired by my Watson travels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by the youth engagement success stories 
  I heard at the Intergenerational Inuquiry event at the UN COP23 Climate Conference.

<h2>The Piece</h2>

<p>
	Balkan youth hold enormous potential for driving change, and must be properly activated by central organizations to advance public
  health and ecological initiatives. The UN COP23 side event, “Intergenerational Inquiry” (II), presented multiple case studies of 
  successful youth climate action. Solomon Island youth mobilized to fill the gap in public health education by creating cyclone 
  emergency kits and action plans. They also mitigated coral bleaching through community education on boating resource management.
  These successful actions in health and ecology demonstrate youth activist multidimensionality. Further, the worldwide UN volunteer
  study reporting one in five youth are monthly volunteers testified to youth passion for action, and found that youth are innovative
  workers with ideas their adult counterparts don’t think of. Besides multidimensionality, energy, and creativity, youth also bring 
  technological aptitude to organizing and activism. The UN Habitat photography competition, for example, demonstrated youth’s use of 
  photography and social media in evocative storytelling: youth disseminated poignant stories on social media to inspire action on 
  pressing issues like climate and health. Finally, the II featured a sixteen-year-old speaker, whose successful action demonstrated 
  that “youth” need not have a floor of eighteen years of age. Youth of all ages can act on diverse issues, leveraging technology 
  and ideas their older colleagues don’t have, to galvanize support and effect meaningful change. These case studies demonstrate 
  that Balkan youth can be mobilized as effective change-drivers.

  My travels in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH), however, have painted a bleak picture of inactive, widely-unemployed, and disaffected 
  youth who, after graduation from school, are not motivated change-drivers. A lack of debt, lack of compelling job prospects, and 
  an antiquated expectation of socialist-style job placement, leaves young adults unmotivated to find work. Meanwhile, parent-provided 
  housing and spending money facilitate unconcerned, consumptive lifestyles. A lifestyle inertia develops and stops youth engagement 
  in issues like climate change and public health. Not all youth suffer from inertia; some seek work and do activism. The majority’s 
  reality, though, is disaffection and powerlessness. 
</p>
Bill Peduto, a mayor who radically greenified Pittsburgh, a major industrial city, recommends mobilizing and inspiring youth action 
by encouraging the disaffected to take ownership of their movement: youth must be involved and given hope by allowing them to set 
their own goals and to pioneer their own solutions to pressing problems. To this end, a central organization, say an NGO, can share 
their prior experience by guiding a group of interested youth in identifying issues and creating actionable solution plans. The 
guidance and advice would serve as guideposts for youth, who would independently plan, organize, and act by involving other youth—their
friends who otherwise wouldn’t do activism—and make steps toward solving an issue. The independent organization would keep youth 
responsible for their movement, and every result they achieve will reinforce their perception of their own power. Mr. Peduto also 
noted that disaffected groups can be inspired to action through education on possible results they can achieve. For example, he 
promoted green technologies as job creators for the disaffected and their children in an effort to inspire hope for a brighter 
future. The promise of interesting, lucrative, and stable jobs with renewable technologies motivated his citizens to overcome inertia 
and actively participate by advocating for technology development and seeking education and jobs. This forward-looking, hopeful 
motivation works for other issues, such as public health, too: a talking point for youth public health activism is the prospect of 
healthy lives for themselves and their children. Efforts to motivate Balkan youth action must stress the benefits they stand to gain 
first, and the societal benefits of their actions second.

Pre-graduation youth also carry huge potential for organized action, and are not yet disillusioned by societal and economic realities.
While my conversations with their directors of three Brčko, BiH, high schools supported II’s assertion of youth’s enormous energy and 
motivation, the directors lamented a lack of youth program funding. Their students passionately wanted to learn and act, but had no 
channels for action. The II speakers repeated that youth want education, knowledge of issues like climate and health, and are eager to
act. Programming to train youth organizers and activist leaders to independently work on projects would give youth the tools to turn 
their energy into action. Brief programs would be impetuses to later independent action. It would be helpful but nonessential for the
central organization to provide a dedicated workspace for youth use because it would add formality to youth work.

While post-college youth face more inertia than younger youth, both are powerful groups able to drive great change in the Balkans; 
however, they need an initial training and impetus to start acting.
