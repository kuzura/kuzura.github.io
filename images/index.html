			<h1>Everyday Images</h1>
			<p>
			Each day leaves me with an image...
			</p>
      
      <h2>India</h2>
	
	<h3>Gujarat</h3>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>18.2.2018</b><br>
      Long-tailed, grey-haired black-butted monkeys leaping accross roofs.
			</p>
      
      <p>
			<b>17.2.2018</b><br>
      One hundred young hands saluting me after an impromptu speech in a Ghandian boarding school.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>16.2.2018</b><br>
      Village gazes following me.
			</p>
	
	<h3>Rajasthan</h3>
	
      <p>
			<b>15.2.2018</b><br>
      Running after and jumping on the train leaving the station after a rushed biscuit purchase at a stop.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>14.2.2018</b><br>
      Empowered, illiterate solar mamas Teupoo and Isabel from the Cook Islands and Chile, respectively, assembling charge 
	      controllers and solar panel installations in preparation for electrifying their villages at home. Meeting Bunker Roy.
			</p>
    
      <p>
			<b>13.2.2018</b><br>
      The mythical Barefoot College unfolded in front of my eyes. Taking lunch on the floor, alongside village innovators.
	      A team of youth dodging traffic while doing push-ups and running in the middle of the road.
			</p>
      
	<h3>Delhi District</h3>
      <p>
			<b>12.2.2018</b><br>
      Warm reunions with Dhruv and Sanjay, a fabulous meal from Jammu and Kashmir, and a white cloth-wrapped parcel out for delivery.
			</p>
	
	<h2>Nepal</h2>
	
      <p>
			<b>11.2.2018</b><br>
      Dusty, dusty Kathmandu, Durbar Square, and bomb buff momos at Narayan Dai ko Masangalli ko Famous Momo. A bumpy bus ride on a
	      dirt road a hair from deadly cliff while weaving in and out of traffic.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>10.2.2018</b><br>
      Shakyamuni Buddha's birthplace and meditation tree. How can a rock and a tree carry so much energy?
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>2-10.2.2018</b><br>
      Moving extremely slowly, observing three parts of each part of each movement, and noting any mental phenomenon. 
	      Vibrant roses on dark, thorny greens. A spider spinning a web. Fog falling off of a roof. Stillness and agitation.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>1.2.2018</b><br>
      Five am motorcycle ride through Kathmandu, a woman falling out of her seat on a bumpy bus, and young Buddhist monks doing 
	      wheelies.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>31.1.2018</b><br>
      A warm "see you" and the dusty roads of Kathmandu.
			</p>
	
	<h2>India</h2>
	
	<h3>Himachal Pradesh</h3>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>30.1.2018</b><br>
      A smiling elephant plodding along the skyway; unsmiling vendors pushing recycling carts up the skyway.
			</p>	
	
      <p>
			<b>29.1.2018</b><br>
      A mountainside school in Mashobra. A single path connecting the village houses down the mountain.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>28.1.2018</b><br>
      A stray pup, a cutie, really, with a gash on his shoulder. Stepped mountainside farmland. Pine needles crunching under the boots.
			</p>
		
      <p>
			<b>27.1.2018</b><br>
      Fifteen minutes of road in four hours of traffic. Triumph of the commons in directing the flow.
			</p>
		
      <p>
			<b>26.1.2018</b><br>
      Deep night; no heating; GI explosion; quickly waning flushwater in the flushbucket; despair. Hanuman's temple, and the
	      ropecar to it, Shimla.
			</p>
		
      <p>
			<b>25.1.2018</b><br>
      Blue sky once again! And wild monkeys! Foggy blinkers illuminating a dawn tire change.
			</p>
		
      <p>
			<b>24.1.2018</b><br>
      A warm reunion with Jacob.
			</p>
		
      <p>
			<b>23.1.2018</b><br>
      Electrolytes, fluids, and rest.
			</p>
		
      <p>
			<b>22.1.2018</b><br>
      Old Delhi from the minar of Jama Masjid. Incessant honking. Javed's tea treat in the motor-refurbishing section of the market.
			</p>
		
	
      
      
      
      <h2>Vietnam</h2>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>19.12.2017</b><br>
      Ho Chi Minh City motorcyclists gurgle around cars like the river around rocks.
			</p>
	
	
      <h2>Qatar</h2>
	
      <p>
			<b>18.12.2017</b><br>
      A well-dressed perfume vendor's raised eyebrows when I said $95 is out of my price range. I'm flying Qatar, after all!
			</p>
	
      <p>
	      
      <h2>Denmark</h2>
	
			<b>17.12.2017</b><br>
      Wandering endless Christmas markets in København, slurping glögg and street food. The Little Mermaid statue sat on her rock,
	      remorsefully turned away from the smoke stacks behind her. A church with a large dome gave me refuge and warmth while
	      I rested. The street food at Chriania was terrible, the service was great. The dry, crisp clicks of soldiers' bootheels 
	      cracking the icy night air. Endless lights and cheerful music at Tivoli. Rowdy bumper car drivers.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>16.12.2017</b><br>
      Jamming on ice and off-road on a peaceful beach in North Jutland. My first time being augmented by a pedelec.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>15.12.2017</b><br>
      The first part of twenty-six hours (with meal breaks) of college applications.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>14.12.2017</b><br>
      A story coming together, a draft I can show.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>13.12.2017</b><br>
      <a href="http://www.tvindkraft.dk/en/">Tvindkraft windmill.</a> The salvaged and repurposed ship propeller shaft, copper mine gearbox, 
	      and papermill generator are integral to the low-cost, rugged windmill system. Allen, a shipbuilder-turned wind turbine engineer,
	      stands proudly next to the homemade frequency converter he made. The enormous machine, composed of a dizzying number of parts,
	      takes up an entire room. He learned to build it himself.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>12.12.2017</b><br>
      An icy runway ending in road construction, and shoppers on Herning's main strip.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>11.12.2017</b><br>
      Work, work, work. And work.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>10.12.2017</b><br>
      Open-air ice skating and glögg with Sarah and Elena.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>09.12.2017</b><br>
      Holed up in my birdhouse attic doing work, with a heart-warming pause for Friends.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>08.12.2017</b><br>
      A gray day when Stefanos leaves.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>07.12.2017</b><br>
      301 windings on the primary coil of our homemade transformer, and the relief of only 49 windings on the secondary.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>06.12.2017</b><br>
      Rectified, smoothed, DC voltage. The capacitor smooths the peak-to-peak voltage, not the RMS voltage.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>05.12.2017</b><br>
      Death by pushups, and a capacitor explosion. We anticipated the possibility, so we covered the setup with a plastic box.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>04.12.2017</b><br>
      Groovy orange wires snake around a white toroidal transformer--and step the output voltage up to 31.5 V.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>03.12.2017</b><br>
      A day of rest and college applications.
			</p>

      <p>
			<b>02.12.2017</b><br>

			</p>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>01.12.2017</b><br>
      More fire than I've ever seen before in the furnace of a wood-burning power plant.
			</p>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>30.11.2017</b><br>
      Silos full of decomposing manure, intricate machines to harvest and burn the methane, 
	      and a truck to deposit the manure back into the fields.
	      Another large silo where wood is turned into gas, but not by burning.
			</p>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>29.11.2017</b><br>
      Flames devour a weak resistor. I devour succulent lamb legs.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>28.11.2017</b><br>
      A soft dusk rain, pitter patter of wet shoes, and a vision obscured by wet glasses.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>27.11.2017</b><br>
      Three transformers of various sizes and a gym full of young basketball lovers. 
	      A boy, younger than the rest, keeps up with a boy taller than the rest.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>26.11.2017</b><br>
      Three butter, jam, and cheese sandwiches.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>25.11.2017</b><br>
      Endless college websites.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>24.11.2017</b><br>
      Danish countryside at sunset. The Danish sky is as vast as Iowa's. Clouds roll in from the fjord, 
      spurred by wandering winds from Iceland. They're tremendously large. The Danish sky is grander than Iowa's.
			</p>
      
      <p>
			<b>23.11.2017</b><br>
      After an long conversation, an 85-year-old Danish man did a headstand and left.
			</p>
      
       <p>
			<b>22.11.2017</b><br>
      The piercing blue eyes of a man who'd walked from Denmark to Spain, and was returning home after half a year.
