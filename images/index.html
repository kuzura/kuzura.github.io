      <h2>Denmark</h2>

      <a href="http://www.tvindkraft.dk/en/">Tvindkraft windmill.</a>Tvindkraft windmill. The repurposed ship's rotor, mining gearbox, and

      <p>
			<b>12.12.2017</b><br>
      An icy runway ending in road construction, and shoppers on Herning's main strip.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>11.12.2017</b><br>
      Work, work, work. And work.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>10.12.2017</b><br>
      Open-air ice skating and gl√∂gg with Sarah and Elena.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>09.12.2017</b><br>
      Holed up in my birdhouse attic doing work, with a heart-warming pause for Friends.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>08.12.2017</b><br>
      A gray day when Stefanos leaves.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>07.12.2017</b><br>
      301 windings on the primary coil of our homemade transformer, and the relief of only 49 windings on the secondary.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>06.12.2017</b><br>
      Rectified, smoothed, DC voltage. The capacitor smooths the peak-to-peak voltage, not the RMS voltage.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>05.12.2017</b><br>
      Death by pushups, and a capacitor explosion. We anticipated the possibility, so we covered the setup with a plastic box.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>04.12.2017</b><br>
      Groovy orange wires snake around a white toroidal transformer--and step the output voltage up to 31.5 V.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>03.12.2017</b><br>
      A day of rest and college applications.
			</p>

      <p>
			<b>02.12.2017</b><br>
      Daniele's gourgeous homemade pizzas.
			</p>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>01.12.2017</b><br>
      More fire than I've ever seen before in the furnace of a wood-burning power plant.
			</p>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>30.11.2017</b><br>
      Silos full of decomposing manure, intricate machines to harvest and burn the methane, 
	      and a truck to deposit the manure back into the fields.
	      Another large silo where wood is turned into gas, but not by burning.
			</p>
	
	
      <p>
			<b>29.11.2017</b><br>
      Flames devour a weak resistor. I devour succulent lamb legs.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>28.11.2017</b><br>
      A soft dusk rain, pitter patter of wet shoes, and a vision obscured by wet glasses.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>27.11.2017</b><br>
      Three transformers of various sizes and a gym full of young basketball lovers. 
	      A boy, younger than the rest, keeps up with a boy taller than the rest.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>26.11.2017</b><br>
      Three butter, jam, and cheese sandwiches.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>25.11.2017</b><br>
      Endless college websites.
			</p>
	
      <p>
			<b>24.11.2017</b><br>
      Danish countryside at sunset. The Danish sky is as vast as Iowa's. Clouds roll in from the fjord, 
      spurred by wandering winds from Iceland. They're tremendously large. The Danish sky is grander than Iowa's.
			</p>
      
      <p>
			<b>23.11.2017</b><br>
      After an long conversation, an 85-year-old Danish man did a headstand and left.
			</p>
      
       <p>
			<b>22.11.2017</b><br>
      The piercing blue eyes of a man who'd walked from Denmark to Spain, and was returning home after half a year.
